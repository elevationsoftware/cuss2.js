/**
 * Common Use Self Service V2 API Definition (current working version)
 * <h3>Definition of the new CUSS2 API.</h3><p>This API definition describes IATA Common Use Self Service (IATA RP 1706c), a standard that allows multiple airlines or entities to share physical kiosks or other hardware devices to offer self-services to their passengers. These services include, but are not limited to passenger check-in functionality and self-service baggage drop off. The standard also defines how airlines and other application suppliers can develop CUSS-compliant applications that are able to run on any device whose platform is CUSS-compliant.<p>In its official release the API definition is accompanied by the CUSS Specification (CUSS-TS), describing in human readable form (textual and graphical) the concepts, requirements, interaction, workflows and behavior for both CUSS platforms and CUSS applications, and the CUSS Implementation Guide (CUSS-IG) describing best practices and giving examples on how to implement CUSS compliant platforms- and applications.<p>The API requires and includes further schema definitions/domains as listed below<p>- CUSS2 Basic Schemas<br>- CUSS2 Self Bag Drop<br>- CUSS2 Biometrics<br>- CUSS2 Payments<br>- CUSS2 Illumination<p>The IATA Common Use Group (CUG) and the CUSS Technical Solution Group (CUSS-TSG) maintain this API.<p>For bug reports, design issues and/or any other feedback send your e-mail to:<p><a href=\"mailto:c6bb2228.iataonline.onmicrosoft.com@emea.teams.ms\">**CUSS-TSG @ IATA**</a><p>-----------<p>**General and important note on handling timeouts:**<p>In contrast to earlier CUSS versions applications are now responsible for tracking and handling the time and timeouts for any directive that may require longer execution.

/**
 * Platform directives name definitions and descriptions. <p>*Please note:* In contrast to earlier CUSS versions applications are now responsible for tracking and handling the time and timeouts for any directive that may require longer execution. Applications shall use the cancel directive to terminate a too long pending call.<p> *platform_environment:* This is the **second directive** to be issued by the application to get basic information on the specific CUSS Platform implementation.<br> *platform_components:* This directive returns a list of all the implemented components, their characteristics and their object identifiers. This allows the application to check whether all the components that it requires are implemented or not.<br> *platform_applications_staterequest:* This directive is used by the application to request a state change from CUSS Application Manager, which will change the application state if request is approved.<br> *platform_applications_transferrequest:* This directive is used by the application to request an application transfer from the CUSS Application Manager.<br> *platform_applications_acknowledge_accessible:* An application confirms with this directive that it has switched to accessible mode after being activated by the CUSS application manager for the accessible mode.<br> *peripherals_announcement_play:* Requests that an SSML formatted text to be spoken immediately. - Directive requires component identifier and the XML formatted text to be spoken.<br> *peripherals_announcement_pause:* Temporarily suspends any play back currently in progress. -  Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_announcement_resume:* Resumes any paused play back currently in progress. -  Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_announcement_stop:* Stops any play back currently in progress. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_cancel:* Cancels all currently executed and queued directives on this component at the time of issuing this directive. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_query:* Returns the current state/status of the virtual component. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_send:* Sends data from the application to the component. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_setup:* Set up the profile/context of the virtual component and prepare it for application usage. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_userpresent_enable:* Make the virtual component available for the user (e.g. enable a reader device for a document insertion). - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_userpresent_disable:* Make the virtual component unavailable for the user (e.g. disable a reader device from a document insertion). - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_userpresent_offer:* Offers a document or a processed item from the virtual component to the user or to another component. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_conveyors_forward:* Moves a bag to the next position on the conveyor or to the airportâ€™s collector belt. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_conveyors_backward:* Moves a bag back to the previous position on the conveyor or back to the user. - Directive requires component identifier.<br> *peripherals_conveyors_process:* Examine and/or process the bag currently on a belt component to get baggage data like weight, dimensions, LPNs, RFID, and similar. - Directive requires component identifier.<br>
